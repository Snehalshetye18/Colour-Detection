# Colour-Detection
This repository contains a python notebook which has the code of colour detection of any given image. It also has a sample image included. This project is for the submission purposes of the CodeClause Internship.
I have used python libraries such as pandas, numpy, argparse, and opencv
This project helps to detect colours given in any image.
